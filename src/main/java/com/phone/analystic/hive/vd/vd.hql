数据抽取(抽取该模块中需要的字段即可)：
load data inpath '/ods/month=08/day=18' into table logs partition(month=08,day=18);


考虑是否需要udf函数(kpi)：


创建最终结果表表：
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `stats_view_depth` (
  `platform_dimension_id` int,
  `data_dimension_id` int,
  `kpi_dimension_id` int,
  `pv1` int,
  `pv2` int,
  `pv3` int,
  `pv4` int,
  `pv5_10` int,
  `pv10_30` int,
  `pv30_60` int,
  `pv60pluss` int,
  `created` string
  );

创建临时表：
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `stats_view_depth_tmp` (
 dt string,
 pl string,
 col string,
 ct int
);

编写sqoop语句：
sqoop export --connect jdbc:mysql://hadoop01:3306/result \
 --username root --password root \
 --table stats_view_depth --export-dir /hive/log_phone.db/stats_view_depth/* \
 --input-fields-terminated-by "\\01" --update-mode allowinsert \
 --update-key date_dimension_id,platform_dimension_id,kpi_dimension_id \
 ;

先统计pv的值：分组 日期，pl,用户

2018-08-18	website	2A6FB951-F4FC-4886-87C0-E9C9D47D2C5C	pv1
2018-08-18	website	D4289356-5BC9-47C4-8F7D-F16022833E7E	pv1

2018-08-18	website	pv1	2
2018-08-18	website	pv10_30	90

group by


2018-08-17 website 1 pv1
2018-08-17 website 1 pv1
2018-08-17 website 3 pv3

将统计的pv的值和对应的pv1，pv2...等存储到临时表

dt string,
pl string,
col string,
value ''

查询临时表并扩维度:
